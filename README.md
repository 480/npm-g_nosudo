npm-g_nosudo
============

A shell script which will fix the problem where you want to stop using sudo for npm -g on Ubuntu.

Inspired by a day trying to sort various machines out on our system to run code nicely.

Some elements used from [Sindre Sorhus' Guide](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo-linux.md)
and the [referenced Stackoverflow answer](http://stackoverflow.com/a/13021677)

Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 with Bash

##Usage:

Download the script,
chmod +x
Run it.

You can optionally fix the .bashrc automatically.  

If you don't wish to, say "n" and use the output from the script to fix manually.
